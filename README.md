### How to install dependencies?

1. Open a terminal (or command line in Windows OS)
1. Change directory to the project folder

    - Backend:
        ```shell
        cd backend/proplanner/
        ```
    - Frontend:
        ```shell
        cd backend/proplanner/
        ```

1. Install dependencies in both folders respectively

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

# How to start üõ´

1. After installed the dependencies, you will have to fill up `.env` for both backend and frontend servers. The formats are provided as below:
    
    - Backend:

        ```
        DB_HOST=
        DB_NAME=
        DB_USER=
        DB_PWS=
        DB_PORT=
        SECRET_KEY=
        ```

    - Frontend:

        ```
        EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=
        ```

1. Start by navigating to the backend and frontend directory and run the following commends respectively.

    - Backend:
        ```
        npm run dev
        ```

    - Frontend: 
        ```shell
        npx expo start
        ```

# Application Architecture üèóÔ∏è

- Backend

    1. `app.js` acts as a server entry point.
    1. `db.js` includes database settings.
    1. Use Node.js with Express.js as a server side foundation. All main codes and logics are in `/routes` folder:
        - `matrixes.js` where main matrix APIs are stored. It corresponds to *Plan Page* in the app.
        - `users.js` stores all user-related APIs.
        - `auth.js` takes care of token verification. It is used as a middleware for other APIs.  

- Frontend
    The architecture of the application follows React Native framework and was created by Expo (version: 51). 
    - `/api` stores the functions to make API calls.
    - `/app` stores page files (follow the [Expo Tab structure](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/tabs/))
    - `/assests` stores images, licence file, etc.
    - `/components` where the defualt components (created by Expo 51) and custom ccomponents are stored.
    - `constants` where it stores constant variables.
    - `constants` where the defualt hooks (created by Expo 51) are stored.
